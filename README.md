# Chess

## TODO
- move piece (for lookahead: implement castles, etc)
- randomize initial position (check legality)
- 3-fold rep
- insufficient material
- offer/accept draw

## Perf
- perf profile
- cache legal moves

## UI
- start empty, new game btn adds new ID to path
- fetch game by id
- UI drag and drop
- make move & respond
